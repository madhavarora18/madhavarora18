# Hey, My name is Madhav Arora
I am currently studying Core Module 3 (CM3) in Hult International Business School, Boston. 
I am majoring in Business Analytics.
My hobbies include playing golf, reading books, and go karting.
I am really excited and looking forward to learn programming languages such as python, and SQL and become a research analyst.
